## Hub settings

#### First, a list of valid constants and their purpose (MUST be enclosed in {brackets}): 
#### Text constants have three forms: Capitalized, UPPERCASE, and lowercase. For example, {Season} = Spring, {SEASON} = SPRING, {season} = spring.

# CLIENTS = number of clients online
# PLAYERS = number of mobs with clients attached
# MOBS = number of mobs online
# LIVING = number of /mob/living(s) online
# HUMANS = number of /mob/living/carbon/human(s) online
# HUMAN_CLIENTS = number of /mob/living/carbon/human (s) online that have clients
# DEAD = number of /mob/dead online
# OBSERVERS = number of /mob/dead/observer online that have clients

#### Some notes about the above constants:

## /mob/living/carbon is not here because it's being phased out
## observers and ghosts are excluded because they are not generally used here
## and also because there is no convenient list to efficiently get the number of them
## TODO: add observers and ghosts somehow

#### various game things

# TIMEOFDAY = displays the current time of day
# WEATHER = displays the current weather
# SEASON = displays the current season

#### meta game things

# ROUNDTIME = displays the current round time
# MAP = displays the active map's ID

#### other stuff

# null, Null, NULL, nil, Nil, NILL = nothing
